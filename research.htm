<h3>“Image Concreteness and Image-Text Information Fit in Online Marketing: An Empirical Examination of Crowdfunding Success” (with Tianyu Gu, Yu Zhu, and Stephen J. Carson)</h3>

Concreteness is widely recognized as a critical aspect of information representation which affects comprehension, recognition, learning, forgetting, and other outcomes. In this study, I examine the effects of image concreteness and the related issue of image-text information fit on the performance of crowdfunding campaigns. The crowdfunding context is intriguing since different theoretical arguments point to the advantages of more concrete as well as more abstract imagery. I use a deep learning object detection methodology based on Mask RCNN and a long-tailed object detection training dataset and develop a model to define and measure image concreteness. Next, using a combination of object detection, word embedding, and high-dimensional text comparison, I assess the fit between text and image information. I find that image concreteness benefits crowdfunding success, while textual concreteness has mixed effects depending on the location of the text. In addition, a high fit between image and text information improves the performance of crowdfunding projects. The main findings are validated with human subjects. Managerially, the core results on image concreteness and image-text fit offer guidance to designers of crowdfunding and marketing campaigns while the machine learning approach allows online platforms to improve content-serving algorithms and make automated suggestions to entrepreneurs for more effective project design.

<h3>“Viewing Through the Lens of Information Representation: Framing Prosocial Products for Crowdfunding Success” (with Tianyu Gu and Stephen J. Carson)</h3>
In this paper, I investigate how prosocial projects are impacted by concreteness in the message—both image and text—on crowdfunding platforms. Prosocial products and their messaging have been studied extensively in the psychology, economics, and marketing literatures. This topic is interesting since, on one hand, prosocial products are increasingly important with the heightened focus on climate change and social fairness towards underrepresented communities. On the other hand, the percentage of consumers who opt for such products are a fraction of those who say they will. Studies have tried to explain the reasons why consumers choose a prosocial offering and the optimum message framing. To better understand the performance of prosocial products, I incorporate a series of information representation variables, including image concreteness, text concreteness, and image-text information fit into the empirical study. The preliminary findings suggest that prosocial projects raise more funding than their competitors with similar funding scales, entrepreneur experience, and information representation. Further, results show that a high concreteness in image and text and a higher text-image fit for prosocial projects description, has a favorable impact on funding success. Further studies look at the moderating effect of information representation on the advantage of prosocial products, as well as using difference-in-difference to better support the validity of the observed advantage of prosocial products. The investigation is currently on to understand the effect of related events and projects in this genre.


<h3>“Applying Free Thought to Map Brand Concepts” (with Pronobesh Banerjee and Promothesh Chatterjee)</h3>
When consumers think of brands, it is usually in response to a trigger—either voluntarily provided data in response to a survey or involuntarily supplied data by way of social media posts or reviews. In this study, I utilize machine learning tools to capture free flowing thoughts in the form of Twitter feeds and Instagram posts about a brand. I then use them to create brand concept maps using methods such as latent semantic analysis and object detection to draw out brand concepts for various brands. The findings extend current research in the field of brand concept maps.
 
<h3>“Differences in Online Review Content between Old and New Products” (with Stephen J. Carson)</h3>
Online product reviews are one of the most important sources of information influencing the consumer decision making process. The aim of this paper is to compare the content of online reviews for new and established products. I study how consumers evaluate old and new products in the same category based on online reviews and whether there are systematic differences in the type of content discussed for each type of product. I use Amazon review data from two categories to compare review content for a new product with the leading established product in each category. Findings suggest that there is a difference in the way consumers review old and new products. The reviews of new products are highly descriptive and detailed with experiences shared by users. Additionally, when I look at the attribute-wise impact on ratings, I find that attributes that are common to both seem to have a higher impact on the ratings than attributes which stand out in the new product. The present study serves as a pilot to examine the efficacy of machine-based coding of product reviews along several relevant dimensions and probe for potential differences to inform future research.
 
<h3>“Fairness in Crowdfunding Donation” (with Arul Mishra)</h3>
Online donations through crowdfunding platforms offer an interesting proposition to examine the impacts of fairness and ethics. In this study we choose to understand how backers evaluate and support projects considering variability in background, race, gender and composition of fund beneficiaries.
